    <h1>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.
    </h1>
    <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
      He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
      divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
      <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of
      the rest of him,
      <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a
      proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
    <h1>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.
    </h1>
    <h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2>
    <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole
      of her lower arm towards the viewer.
